    <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
 I wanted to talk about a woman I find influential in my respective field. As a Business Marketing major, 
I admire Rihanna the fact that she started her business out of no where and became very successful in uplifting 
women all shapes and sizes as well as complexions from her different lines. 
She is such an influential person and helps many people around the world and I would like to do that someday. 
    I plan to use my degree as support for small businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations to expand and better market their businesses. 
I would also like to create and manage my own company, helping people in need like implementing various shelters to accommodate and assist the homeless population by working alongside them to get them the appropriate help they need, job interviews, hygiene products, and reconnecting with displaced family.
 As a person of color, I aspire to impact the world as best I can to try and make a difference in the world like so many others. 
 I can thank Rihanna for giving me ideas and confidence in following my dreams and trying many new things.
