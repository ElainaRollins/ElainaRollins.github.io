                        <p>Technology is ever-changing and those wanting to remain at the helm of innovation must adapt.
                            The consumer journey is
                            charting a new course as customers and companies alike embrace emerging technologies. As
                            tech trends such as artificial
                            intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation (RPA) become more pervasive, the world will
                            look to brands who can
                            deliver with accuracy and real-time efficiency.</p>

                                    Technology?</strong></span>

                            To help meet the demands of a technology-enabled consumer base, solution providers must
                            embrace digital transformation
                            to realize their full potential. But, where to begin? These are the top 15 emerging
                            technologies that businesses need to
                            keep an eye on in 2021.

                        <p>Artificial intelligence is poised as a tool of choice for businesses and solution providers.
                            As is often seen with
                            social media, AI, combined with machine learning, deep learning and neural networks, can be
                            a powerful combination.
                            Businesses can use AI to achieve cost-saving benefits, streamline workflows, improve the
                            customer experience, enable
                            more efficient communications through chatbots, increase customer satisfaction, and provide
                            insight into purchasing
                            behavior.

                            Additionally, machine learning can analyze large datasets and provide scaled insight. We are
                            currently just scratching
                            the surface of how machine learning and AI can work together to enable businesses. Current
                            applications provide huge
                            growth potential for solution providers who can fully understand the capabilities and
                            functionality of AI to tailor
                            solutions to meet business demands.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Blockchain</strong></span></h3>
                        <p>Past discussions of blockchain often hinged on cryptocurrency, but the real power lies in the
                            immutability and
                            transparency of a blockchain. Blockchains use distributed ledger technology resulting in a
                            fixed and highly visible
                            record of activity with high potential for business applications.

                            The blockchain is an information system that holds promise for supply chain management,
                            enabling transparency into the
                            journey of materials from origin to product. Blockchain technology will also allow for
                            better record management,
                            providing a snapshot of any record from its origination. This could be used to verify
                            orders, purchases, returns,
                            receipt of product—you name it.

                            Smart contracts are another blockchain application that ensures delivery of conditions.
                            Smart contracts release data
                            when both participants have met the criteria of an agreement. They offer endless
                            capabilities for ensuring agreements
                            are carried out and therefore can help position you as a trusted solution provider.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Computer Vision
                                </strong></span></h3>
                        <p><a href="https://connect.comptia.org/blog/emerging-trends-in-information-technology">Computer
                                Vision</a> This field allows computers to derive meaning from visual input, and then
                            take action or make decisions based on that
                            data. Computer vision requires a huge amount of data to train algorithms to understand
                            subtle differences and recognize
                            different visual inputs.

                            There is significant business potential for computer vision, which could inspect products
                            and processes as part of
                            quality control to analyze for nearly imperceptible differences and imperfections. Business
                            applications include using
                            Google Translate to translate signage to a native language and making sense of traffic signs
                            in self-driving cars.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Customer Data Platforms</strong></span></h3>
                        <p>If data is the new gold, then customer data platforms are the new banks. Businesses benefit
                            from knowing as much about
                            customers as possible so that they can hyper-personalize experiences and know how best to
                            reach and engage prospects and
                            customers. But often, knowledge is disparate, located across several systems or platforms
                            with no single unifying
                            source. Customer data platforms bring this information together into a single source to
                            provide a comprehensive picture
                            of consumers and eliminate the potential for unclean data.

                        <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Cybersecurity Mesh</strong></span>
                        </h3>
                        <p>Cybersecurity no longer operates as an addendum in the world of information technology. As
                            companies made the move to
                            remote working models during the pandemic, a few pressing issues came to light. Not only is
                            cybersecurity an absolutely
                            critical element of business operations, but traditional approaches are not flexible enough
                            to accommodate for a
                            large-scale remote workforce.

                            Cybersecurity mesh is a completely different approach to digital security. Cybersecurity
                            mesh allows companies to create
                            security measures based on the identity of a device, rather than proximity to secure
                            connections. It’s a distributed
                            approach rather than defining a perimeter based on network reach. In addition, cybersecurity
                            mesh also allows for easy
                            scalability across a distributed workforce.</p>
                        <h3><span style="color: #318dee;"><strong>Digital Health</strong></span></h3>
                        <p>If COVID-19 left a legacy that will remain, it’s digital health. As patients became unable to
                            visit doctor’s offices and
                            hospitals, digital health rose to fill the gap. But now that hurting or sick individuals
                            have realized there are
                            opportunities for receiving appropriate healthcare without in-person visitation, they are
                            taking advantage of that
                            opportunity. This fad is certainly here to stay and will likely give rise to associated
                            technologies that leverage
                            innovations such as biometrics to produce smart or connected medical equipment that will
                            enable continued distanced
                            medical examinations.</p>
